# Independent Study - Social Media and Humanitarian Operations

This is the code and the final (admittedly, rough) report behind my independent study from Fall 2019 at McGill University under the supervision of [Professor Chang Yoo](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/changseung-chang-yoo). This study examined the impact of social media on the humanitarian operations of the Canadian Red Cross during the 2018 Fort McMurray wildfires.

This project would not have been possible without help from Dixon Wong and Thomas Villeneuve.
